# CoinFrog

[Link to Live Site Here]()

The purpose of CoinFrog is to allow users to gain an insight into all cryptocurrencies available on CoinMarketCap. They will be able to enter a coin they want to know more about and the programme will output the relevant information. CoinFrog also has a price converter function where users can calculate how much USD or coins to buy given what they want to find out.

CoinFrog is a Python only programme which is run on a mock terminal. Once Run users will be navigated to the Main Menu where they can chose what they would like to do. The first option will allow them to view the 'Program Info' which will provide a description of what the program is and the features it has. The second option will allow them to 'Get Coin Info' where users enter a ticker and a description of the coin will appear. As well as this, users will be able to view the coins data e.g price, market cap, TVL etc.  
The final option will navigate them to the 'Crypto Converter' where users will have two options. The first will ask the user to enter the USD amount they would like to spend and then the coin they would like to buy. The program will then calculate the amount of that coin they can buy with the USD available. The second option will allow the user to enter a coin and the amount they wish to buy and the program will calculate the USD needed to purchase it.

* ## Design 

* ## Scope 

    * When creating CoinFrog I will take a waterfall approach when developing. That is, creating sections of the program at a time and ensuring they work as intended before going onto the next section. I will be able to break up development by choosing small elements to work on daily, ensuring the website can be built and published in a timely fashion. As this project Python only all my time will be spent on developing and testing the logic behind the program. So I will work on developing each class and function within each class and getting them working before I move onto the next section of development. 

* ## Structure 

* ## Flowcharts

* I used [LucidChart](lucidchart.com) to help design the project and create the following flowcharts.

# Features 

Here describes the main features of the website and what the user can expect when viewing ~

## Existing Features:


## Future Features:


# Technologies 
## Languages Used

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used:

1. [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/):
    * GitPod was the IDE used to create the site

2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/):
    * Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.

3. [GitHub](https://github.com/):
    * GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git. It was also used to deploy the project (GitHub Pages)

4. [Google Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/):
    * Used to test code throughout development

5. [Os Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
    * Used to clear the console.

6. [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/login)
    * Used to Deploy the Project

7. [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/)
    * Used to design my flowcharts.

8. [AMiResponsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)
    * To generate the image at the beginning of the README

9. [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/)
    * Used the CoinMarketCap API to retrieve live coin data

# Testing 

Due to the size of the testing section for CoinFrog I have created [TESTING.md](TESTING.md). It also shows all tested screenshots, any errors/bugs I encountered, and how I fixed them when creating this project. This is also where you can find any responsiveness screenshots, and browser compatibility tests.

# Deployment 


## Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

    $ `git clone ADD NAME HERE` 

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created. 

```
$ git clone ADD NAME HERE
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```
